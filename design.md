## Technology

The platform will be built using the following technologies:

### Programming language

The platform will be built using the Go programming language, which is known for its concurrency features and performance.

### Web application framework

The platform will utilize a web application framework like Echo to handle the server-side logic and database interaction.

### Front-end framework
