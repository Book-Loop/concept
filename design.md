# The Book Loop Design Document

The Book Loop is a subscription-based service that provides an opportunity for writers to earn continuously from their books by providing multiple versions, mentorship, videos, courses, etc. around that topic. The organization is open to all kinds of ideas that will make it more inclusive and helpful for writers.

## Overview

The Book Loop is a subscription-based service that provides an opportunity for writers to earn continuously from their books by providing multiple versions, mentorship, videos, courses, etc. around that topic. The organization is open to all kinds of ideas that will make it more inclusive and helpful for writers.

## Architecture

The Book Loop will be built as a web application using the following technologies:

- NextJS - A React framework that provides server-side rendering and other useful features
- PostgreSQL - A powerful, open source object-relational database system
- Go - A powerful, open source programming language
- Docker - A containerization platform that enables the creation and deployment of applications in a portable and scalable way

The system will consist of the following components:

1. Frontend - A NextJS app that will provide the user interface for the application
2. Backend API - A Golang application that will provide the logic and interface with the database
3. Database - A PostgreSQL database to store data related to the service

## Frontend

The frontend of The Book Loop will be a single-page application built with NextJS. It will include the following features:

- User registration and login
- Subscription management
- Book updates and versions
- Mentorship and courses
- Video library

The frontend will communicate with the backend API using RESTful endpoints. The use of Axios will be employed to perform HTTP requests from the frontend.

## Backend

The backend of The Book Loop will be a Golang application that will provide the API for the frontend to consume. It will include the following features:

- User authentication and authorization
- Subscription management
- Book management and updates
- Mentorship and course management
- Video library management

The backend will communicate with the PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve data related to the service. The use of Gorilla Mux and sqlx will be employed to build the API.

## Database

The PostgreSQL database will store data related to the service, including:

- User information
- Book information
- Subscription information
- Mentorship and course information
- Video library information

The use of Docker will be employed to create a containerized instance of the PostgreSQL database for local development and deployment purposes.

## Conclusion

The Book Loop will be built using NextJS and PostgreSQL with Docker, creating a powerful and scalable web application that will enable writers to earn continuously from their books. With the frontend, backend, and database all working together, The Book Loop will provide an easy-to-use platform for writers to provide updates and new versions to their readers.
